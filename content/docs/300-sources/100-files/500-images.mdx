Contentlayer 目前不支持图像处理，尽管我们正在[计划实现它](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/11). 在此之前，当 Contentlayer 处理您的内容时，您可以采用几种不同的方法来处理图像：

- [框架工具](#lean-on-the-framework) (正式建议)
- [原始本地文件](#using-unprocessed-images)
- [图像管理服务](#using-an-image-management-services)
- [手动图像处理](#manually-processing-images)

以下各节将进一步详细介绍这些方法。

## 依靠框架

像 Next.js 这样的一些框架能够在服务器端处理图像，根据当前视口大小提供最佳图像。当框架有这个工具可用时，您通常可以使用本地或远程存储的图像。

具体的实现方式会因您使用的框架而异。有关更多详细信息，请参阅[我们的环境指南](/docs/environments)。

## 使用未处理的图像

Most frameworks come with a _public_ or _static_ directory feature, where any files you place in that directory are automatically added to the output directory. If the tool you're using doesn't have this by default, it's likely there is a configuration option or the ability to make it work.

The simplest approach in working with images is to place your images in this public/static directory and store the reference to them as a `string` field.

For example, consider a post model with an image field:

```js
defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  fields: {
    image: { type: string },
  },
}))
```

In the frontmatter of your content files, you'd store a reference to an image:

```yaml
---
title: Why Contentlayer is Awesome
image: /images/why-contentlayer.png
# ...
---
```

### 原始图像的后果

The downside to this approach is that it isn't optimal for page speed performance. You want to ensure your images are as crisp as they need to be, while also being as small as they can be. This is an okay first step to get things working, but not the best approach for production.

## 使用图像管理服务

Alternatively, you can use an image management service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [Imgix](https://imgix.com/). (There are many to choose from.)

These services allow you to use URL parameters to determine the size and shape of your image. The image is then optimized by these services and delivered to your users.

These services deliver an optimized image, but it's still up to you to ensure that image doesn't degrade the performance of your pages. Therefore, you may also want to consider manually processing the images. See below for details.

## 手动处理图像

For the time being, unless the framework you're using supports processing images, manually processing is the best way to ensure page speed.

To handle processing manually, you must decide if you want to do the processing _during_ the Contentlayer build or _after_.

### 将图像处理为计算字段

To process images during the Contentlayer build, you can use a computed field. Say you're storing the images locally. You could have a field called `imageSrc` that points to the location of the image.

```yaml
---
title: Why Contentlayer is Awesome
imageSrc: /images/why-contentlayer.png
# ...
---
```

Then you'd add a _computed_ field like `image` that would do the processing.

```js
defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  computedFields: {
    image: {
      type: string,
      resolve: (doc) => {
        // do the processing, and return new value ...
      },
    },
  },
}))
```

Note that if you don't also specify the `imageSrc` as a field, you'll run into a warning from Contentlayer. To avoid that, you can tell Contentlayer to ignore extra fields.

```js
export default makeSource({
  onExtraFieldData: 'ignore',
  // ...
})
```

### Contentlayer 生成后的处理

另一种选择是在应用程序中构建一个进行处理的实用程序方法。在这种情况下，Contentlayer 已经将图像引用作为字符串进行了处理，您将在构建要发送到页面的道具之前将其发送到处理实用程序。

### 使用 Contentlayer 处理 Markdown 中的图像

值得注意的是，上面的方法只处理前面指定的图像。如果你想处理你在 markdown 或 MDX 文件中使用过的图像，你需要构建（或找到）一个注释或重新键入插件。
